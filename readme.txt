This plugin adds an "Unclickable" checkbox to menu items to apply the cursor: default; css to them and make their destination URL be #

== Description ==

When creating menus with sub-items, sometimes you don't want the parent item to correspond to a destination URL. In this case, you want to make it unclickable, so users don't accidentally navigate away from the page. This plugin allows you to make any menu item unclickable by overriding the destination URL to "#" and making the cursor be default instead of the normal 'hand' imagery for a clickable item.

Typically you create parent items as a "Custom Link" menu type. Whatever URL you enter in the custom link (including leaving it blank) will be replaced with "#".

This is just  shortcut for site builders who aren't comfortable slipping some CSS into the menu themselves and want to go GUI all the way. Also, it's easier to explain to novices.
